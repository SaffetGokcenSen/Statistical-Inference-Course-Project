# Statistical-Inference-Course-Project
First of all, the equations written in LATEX are not rendered in the md file. Hence, a pdf form of the report has been included in the repository. In this repository, a simulation exercise and a basic inferential data analysis are presented. In the simulation exercise, a sample average distribution is going to be obtained by sampling an exponential distribution. The properties of the sample average distribution are to be compared to the expected properties by virtue of the central limit theorem. In the basic inferential data analysis part, the ToothGrowth data in the R datasets package will be analysed. The data will be explored and summed up first. Then, the effect of supplementaries and the dose on the tooth growth will be examined using confidence intervals and hypothesis tests.
